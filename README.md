# CPSC-471 Programming Assignment 1
 Simple HTTP Server

 Make sure before all testing that you run the server before anything else via your IDE

 After "Ready to serve..." text comes you can enter in your browser
 http://*YOUR IP ADDRESS*:800/HelloWorld.html
 This will display the html page HelloWorld.html from the directory.

 To test for the 404 error you must run the server again as the program will stop after serving the page
 you can enter any incorrect file name after the port number to have the 404 error appear
 example: http://*YOUR IP ADDRESS*:800/asdf.html

 For the client test you can run it using the format specified
 client.py localhost 800 HelloWorld.html
